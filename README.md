# U-Net
U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation and more real world example 

implimenting U Net and than using the pretrained model for some applications 
mostly corona related because that what everyone talks about right now 

additionaly there is a lot of X-ray and CT scans are available [here](https://academictorrents.com/download/136ffddd0959108becb2b3a86630bec049fcb0ff.torrent)

## U-Net architecture

### Lung Segmentation from Chest X-rays using Variational Data Imputation

After UNet I am thinking of implimenting [this](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10052.pdf)
with data generated by this i can train UNet more efficiently (MAYBE)


here is the Covid Chest X-Ray [DATASET](https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset)

for more Drug related stuff here is my repo for that [MAT](https://github.com/shauray8/MAT)
